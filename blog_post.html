                    treat for birthdays, weddings, and just an average weekday.<br> Yes, the quickest way to make a
                    cupcake is to start with a cake mix, and we're definitely not opposed to creative twists on a mix.
                    <br> But if you're really wanting to impress your family and friends, it's nice to know how to make
                    vanilla cupcakes (and all other flavors) from scratch.

                <h2 id="h2_style">How to Make Cupcakes</h2>
                <article id="art_style">If you've already worked on your layered cake-making skills, it's going to be a
                    cinch to start baking cupcakes.
                    <br> Before we get started, choose a cupcake recipe and preheat your oven, which will ensure even
                    and accurate baking.
                    <br> You can also turn a cake recipe into cupcakes (like this easy yellow cake), just plan to use ¼
                    cup of batter for each cupcake.
                </article>
                <h3 id="h3_style">Step 1: Prepare Ingredients</h3>
                <article id="art_style">Allow the butter and eggs to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. This will
                    make the butter easier to blend.
                    <br>Room temperature eggs allow more air to be incorporated into your batter for a lighter texture.
                    <br>Grease and flour twelve 2½-inch muffin cups or line with paper baking cups (Target); set aside.
                </article>
                <h3 id="h3_style">Step 2: Combine Butter and Sugar</h3>
                <article id="art_style">Many cupcake recipes call for beating the butter and sugar together for 1
                    minute, using a hand mixer $34.99 (Bed Bath & Beyond) or stand mixer.
                    <br> This is called creaming, and it creates little pockets of air in the mixture, resulting in
                    light and fluffy cupcakes. Just be sure not to overbeat the mixture.
                    <br> You can tell you've gone too far if the butter starts to separate.

                <h3 id="h3_style">Step 3: Add Eggs and Vanilla </h3>
                <article id="art_style">
                    After creaming the butter and sugar, most cupcake recipes next call for adding the eggs.
                    Depending on the recipe, you may add whole eggs, just egg yolks, or just egg whites.
                    Some recipes include other ingredients to add along with the eggs, such as vanilla or other
                    flavorings.
                    <br><br> <strong><em>Kitchen Tip:</em></strong> Break eggs individually into a custard cup or small
                    bowl
                    first.
                    This way, if you get shell fragments, you can easily fish them out, rather than trying to get them
                    out of the batter

                <h3 id="h3_style">Step 4: Alternate Adding Dry and Wet Ingredients
                </h3>
                <article id="art_style">In a separate mixing bowl (Crate & Barrel), stir together the dry ingredients,
                    such as flour, salt, and baking powder. Most cupcake recipes call for alternately adding the dry
                    ingredients and the wet ingredients (like milk or cream), beating between each addition. Don't be
                    tempted to add everything at once. Adding all of the wet ingredients at once can cause the batter to
                    separate, resulting in a heavy cake. Adding all of the dry ingredients at once can make the batter
                    too thick, which can lead to overmixing.</article>
                <h3 id="h3_style">Step 5: Fill the Cupcake Liners
                </h3>
                <article id="art_style">Wondering how much batter to use per cupcake? For standard 2½-inch cupcakes,
                    fill cupcake liners with ¼ cup batter to about ⅔ to ¾ of the way full. Avoid adding too much batter,
                    or the cupcakes will overflow the cups as they bake and cause a mess. Here are some easy ways to
                    fill cupcake liners with cupcake batter:<br><br></article>

                <blockquote>
                    <li id="art_style">If the batter is thick, use two spoons to scoop it into the cups.</li>
                    <li id="art_style">Use a medium ice cream or cookie scoop to spoon batter into the cups.</li>
                    <li id="art_style">Fill a heavy resealable plastic bag with batter and cut a small hole in one
                        corner.
                        Squeeze the bag gently to fill the cups. Plug the bag's hole with your finger as you move it to
                        the
                        next cup.</li>
                    <li id="art_style">If your batter is thin, pour it into a large glass measuring cup. The spout on
                        the
                        measuring cup will make it easier to fill cupcake liners with batter.</li>

                <article id="art_style">
                    For chocolate, vanilla, and most other cupcake recipes, you'll want to bake for 15 to 20 minutes in
                    an oven preheated to 350°F. Test for doneness by inserting a wooden toothpick into the center a
                    cupcake. If the toothpick is clean when you remove it, the cupcakes are done. If wet batter or
                    several moist crumbs cling to the toothpick, they need to bake longer. Cool the cupcakes for 5
                    minutes in the pan before moving them to a wire rack to cool completely

                <h3 id="h3_style">Step 7: Frost and Decorate</h3>
                <article id="art_style">For the prettiest cupcakes, start with decorative liners. It's the easiest way
                    to spruce them up for special occasions. From there, use a piping bag (Michaels) to decorate your
                    cupcakes. If you don't have piping bags, use a resealable plastic bag with the end snipped off, or
                    simply spread with a knife. For an unforgettable dessert, feel free to go wild with holiday
                    toppings, sprinkles, nuts, or whatever your heart desires.</article>
